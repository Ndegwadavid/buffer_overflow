# What is Buffer overflow vulnerability
This type of vulnerability is most
often due to a memory operation like a copy or move that overwrites data outside its intended
memory area. When the overwrite occurs on the stack, this leads to a stack buffer overflow.
Its from here that we shall be able to trick the CPU to perform code execution
